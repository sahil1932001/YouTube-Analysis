# YouTube-Analysis

### Problem statement: We have to extract the data of multiple YouTube channels and we have to analyze that using Tableau


So for making this first I used YouTub API key and after that using API key I extracted the live data of 9 different channels
channel names are '5 minutes engineering', '365 data science', 'Alex the Analyst', 'codebasics', 'ken jee', 'krish naik', 'techTFQ','thu vu data analytics','tina Huang'.

After this i made one function to extract all the statistics from different channels eg, channel name, Subscribers, Views, Total_videos, playlist_id.
we extracted the playlist_id to extarct video informations from different channels.

after that i made dataframe using this statistics.
then performed EDA and VDA.

after that i made one funection to extract video_id using playlist_id
and then made function to extarct video details using video_id.
in video details i extracted video title, video Published_date, Views, likes and comments.

and then perform different visulization for videos.

for making this project i used python.
and for visualization i used tableau.

below you can see the dashboard.
